;;; Commentary:
;
;; This file provides functions to scale faces. Unlike the functions
;; provided by the text-scale mode in face-remap.el, these functions
;; apply to all of the faces, not just the default face.

;;; Code:

(defvar gfs/magnify-factor 1.2

Scaling is accomplished by multiplying (or dividing) the face
:height by this factor.")

If an attempt is made to scale the face height below this
threshold, this value will be used.")

(defvar gfs/face-max-size 1000
  "The maximum face :height.
If an attempt is made to scale the face height above this
threshold, this value will be used.")

faces and has an explicit height."
